A simulation of the famous board game Candyland is created and several number of games are simulated. Finally a histogram is generated and the results are observed.
Factors that are observed are:
1. Longest number of turns taken by one person to finish a game.
2. Shortest number of turns taken by one person to finish a game.
3. Average number of turns taken to finish a game
4. Average length of a game if four people are playing together.
